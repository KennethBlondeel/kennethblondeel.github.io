            Hello, im Kenneth Blondeel a freelance front-end developer and
            graphic designer from Belgium. This year I graduated as a developer
            and i am always eager to learn about new things. In the past I have
            worked with SCSS, CSS, HTML, javascript, vue, github and MYSqL and I
            also have knowledge of adobe(photoshop, illustrator, indesign and
            adobeXD). I specialized in the modern framework called vue. Making
            webapplications that users enjoy makes me happy. In the project page
            I made an overview of al the projects i have worked on. If i can
            help you with you're projects feel free to contact me and maybe we
            can work together.
